# wasm parser concept
The extension of WASM is based on the idea of COP-like (concept-oriented programming by Alexandr Savinov) through C++ concepts and a feature-based architecture. The root layer defines the core concepts and extension mechanisms of binary format, followed by the section concepts and extension mechanisms in binary format, and the third layer of MVP defines the most basic section types using parsing strategies within sections, which provide type-safe extension points through ADL (Argument Dependent Lookup). Subsequent extensions or standards can extend the sections reserved in the MVP by defining new feature types or adding new policy extensions, which can continue to be further extended to form a hierarchical WASM feature tree. This design makes it possible to update the standard without modifying the existing implementation each time (provided that the upper level concepts are not touched, e.g., extended using some fantastic tips), and only need to satisfy the conceptual constraints of extensibility, which can be conveniently extended through template metaprogramming and compile-time polymorphism, while guaranteeing type-safety and correctness of the implementation.

* `Concept-First Design`: The entire architecture is built around concepts rather than concrete types
* `Compositional Extensibility`: Features can be composed and extended without modifying existing code
* `Compile-time Verification`: Extensive compile-time checks ensure conceptual consistency
* `Separation of Concerns`: Features are isolated and can be developed independently
